        The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis
        lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a
        domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the
        wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
        carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister
        taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
        first domesticated,[12][13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor
        of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first species to be
        domesticated,[14][16]<br /><br />
        and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
        sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17] Their long
        association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human
        behavior[18], and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
        inadequate for other canids.[19] Dogs vary widely in shape, size, and
        colors.[20]<br /><br />
        They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling
        loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and,
        more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles. This
        influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
        friend."
